A GitHub Actions toolkit for Go!

## Project Description

If you want to write non-trivial GitHub Actions you really only have 2 choices:

- Use NodeJS and [actions/toolkit]
- Use Docker and your language of choice

The latter option suffers because you likely have to implement *a lot* of stuff yourself to do things like:

- Retrieve action inputs and handle them
- Write to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and/or `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
- Writing [Workflow Commands] to provide feedback in the logs
- Platform independent filepath manipulations
- Executing external commands
- Responding to `${{ runner.debug }}` for writing debug logs
- Source file annotations
- Grouping logs
- And more...

And the former means you have to write Javascript... ðŸ‘€

### Go and GitHub Actions

I put it to you that Go could be an *excellent* language for writing GitHub actions:

- It's fast and memory efficient (saving ðŸ’µ on private GitHub runner costs)
- Excellent support for concurrency and asynchronous execution
- A powerful, batteries included standard library with more or less everything an action author needs out of the box
- It plays excellently with Docker, leading to tiny, very efficient images
- It's simple and safe
- General purpose enough to be able to everything an action might want to do

> [!TIP]
> You don't even need Docker! You could just `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build <your action>` and fetch the binary
> (e.g. from a GitHub release) inside a [composite action] and pass the inputs as command line arguments/flags!

The only thing missing is a toolkit providing sensible, common functionality for GitHub Action authors... That's where `actions` comes in!

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/actions@latest
